# LC3 - vm

The one written in C works, the one in Python does not and after a few hours of debugging couldn't be bothered to keep going. The error has smthng to do with the Program Counter going out of bounds, so I assume it isnt incrementing correctly.

# Help Used
I used this guide https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/
and ClaudeAI for help learning bitshifting, bitmasking, and a few other concepts such as how to read the LC-3's 16bit instructions and how to process them.

It isn't crazy refined but it works!

PS I hate enums to an extent I cannot explain. Incase you dont know (which you already do but I did not) enums need to be in a specific order.
